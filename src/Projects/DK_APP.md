# DK App

This is a work in progress project.  I plan for it to be a general day to day app for me and my partner to use for grocery lists, todo lists, budgeting, keeping recipes, etc.  I am also using this project to create a full inclusive line by line tutorial on how it is made.

It has a fastAPI server with SQLite running in a docker container for the backend, and will eventually have a web react, and native react apps for the front end.
