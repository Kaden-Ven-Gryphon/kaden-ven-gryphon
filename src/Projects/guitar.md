# AR Guitar App

![image](../Resources/Guitar.gif)

This was a project I helped with as a student specialist.  It was part of a collaboration between the business collage, and the science collage and a few professors.  I was hired to do the programing and some of the design.

It uses OpenCV for python.  It converts a set of local coordinates measured from the marker to the frets on the guitar, and uses the marker to translate the local coordinates to the actual screen coordinates.  You can flip through different cords and it will display colored dot where your fingers are supposed to go that match the color dots on your finger tips.  The number is the mean distance that your fingers are from the correct spot.

I think it also had a metronome to eventual be able to set a list of chords to switch automatically, and options to display the full hand skeleton.
